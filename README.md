## Tech Stack

IncontiSense is built using the following cutting-edge technologies:

* Modularization: Organizing a codebase into loosely coupled and self-contained parts.
* Clean architecture: A method of software development in which you should be able to identify what a program performs merely by looking at its source code.
* Alarm Manager: A method that gives you a way to perform time-based operations outside the lifetime of your application.
* Hilt: Dependency injection for clean and modular code.
* Room database: Robust local data storage and caching for uninterrupted offline access.
* MVVM architecture: Well-structured and maintainable codebase.
* Kotlin Coroutines: A concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously.
* Splash Screen 12: Create an engaging and visually appealing launch experience using the Splash Screen API.
